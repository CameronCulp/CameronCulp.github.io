                Hi my name is Cameron Culp and I am a student of computer science class at Plymouth High School. I was born in Rochester but have lived
                in different places. I like to work with computers and other devices. I have always loved video games and other stuff. My love 
                for technology is what got to me to want to join this class.<br> <br>
                
                The wolf is my spirit animal. The wolf is the symbol of guardianship, ritual, strength, loyalty, spirit.
                 Wolves can help represent things because they work together in groups to hunt for there food. It has been said that Wolf kills are
                 good for the soil by giving it nutrients and it helps keep the ecosystem in control. Wolves can be trained to be used as pets
                 or you can train them right to help do people searches and stuff.   
                        </p> <br>
