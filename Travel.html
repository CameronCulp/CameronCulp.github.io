					The place that I want to visit is Tokyo Japan. One of the reasons that 
					I want to visit Tokyo is that the shows that I watch and the stuff that
					I do originally comes from Japan. I have always been interested in Tokyo 
					because they have a really big city but they also are known for there games
					or anime and etc.
