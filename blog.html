        <h2>Favorite Videogames</h2>
        <h6>March 3, 2020</h6>
        
        <p>My favorite Videogame got started all when I started playing racing or shooting games.
        My favorite videogames would be between the call of duty games or the need for speed games.
        The reason that I love the need for speed games is that I get the thrill of racing cars
        and being able to smash racers or cops in the game. The reason that I love the call of duty
        games is for the reason that I love the thrill of being able to kill people to level up and get
        better guns.

        <h2>Favorite Shows</h2>
        <h6>March 4, 2020</h6>
        
        <p>My favorite shows are between Naruto, Dragon Ball, and My Hero Academia.
        The reason that I have Naruto under the list is because the main character is 
        inspirational and that he went from a kid that was hated to a kid that is a hero
        and is valued by other people. The reason Dragon Ball is under my list is because I 
        love fighting shows and the story line of the show is amazing. The things that I watch
        My Hero Academia for is the fighting scenes and that the main character was powerless
        and looked down on until one day he got a power of his own and is being trained by 
        the number 1 super hero.
